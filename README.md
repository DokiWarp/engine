# How to submit a pull request
Attach a `.sprite3` file to your pull request that contains all scripts you've added or modified.
You must properly attach comments to the top of each script that provide where the scripts are supposed to go, and if they're original additions or modifications of pre-existing scripts.

Please ensure all custom extensions used in your scripts are in [TurboWarp's](https://extensions.turbowarp.org/) or [SharkPool's](https://sharkpools-extensions.vercel.app/) extension gallery. Any scripts that contain extensions which are not contained in these galleries will be rejected.
