# Notices
**⚠️ Some image assets that come pre-packaged inside the engine may not be suitable for sensitive viewers.**

**⚠️ Updates to the engine are only tested on unmodified versions of the DokiWarp engine. We're not liable for any updates not working on someone else's modified engine.**

<br><br>

DokiWarp is a visual novel engine made in TurboWarp created with the sole purpose of making it easier to make Doki Doki Literature Club "mods". **<sub>(This engine is likely not suitable for creating independant visual novels!)</sub>**

DokiWarp is ran entirely by volunteers, contributors do not make money from this project and we do not accept donations.

All Doki Doki Literature Club assets are intellectual property of [Team Salvato](https://teamsalvato.com/).


# Documentation
Coming soon.


# How to submit a pull request
**⚠️ Ensure you made your update on the latest official version of DokiWarp.**
<br><br>
Attach a `.sprite3` file to your pull request that contains all scripts you've added or modified.
You must properly attach comments to the top of each script that provide where the scripts are supposed to go, and if they're original additions or modifications of pre-existing scripts.

Please ensure all custom extensions used in your scripts are in [TurboWarp's](https://extensions.turbowarp.org/) or [SharkPool's](https://sharkpools-extensions.vercel.app/) extension gallery. Any scripts that contain extensions which are not contained in these galleries will be rejected.

<br><br>

**"Why can't I just send a modified `.sb3` file of the engine?"**
<br>
Because we can't verify your changes. We would love to assume good faith but we want to make sure DokiWarp is free of any malicious scripts.


# License
**We're working on finding a suitable software license to put DokiWarp under, for now please follow these rules;**
* You may distribute your game made with DokiWarp as long as you have not modified or removed the splash screen.
* You may modify the DokiWarp engine to your liking. Please ask [Slate](https://github.com/monika-fan70) for permission to distribute it.
